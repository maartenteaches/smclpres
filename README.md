`smclpres` : creating .smcl presentations from a .do file
=====================

Description
-----------

A .smcl presentation is a series of linked .smcl files that open in the viewer inside Stata (like help-files). They are interactive. Click on links to execute .do files or move from one slide to the next. They are particularly useful for talks that focus on how to do things in Stata, like a lecture on graphs in Stata or a talk at a Stata Users' Group meeting. 

The main reason for using a .smcl presentation is the ability to easily show lots of examples of how to do things in Stata. So writing a .smcl presenttion involves writing lots of example code. The purpose of **smclpres** is to streamline the process of turning all those examples into a .smcl presentation.
