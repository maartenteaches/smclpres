{pstd}Consider the table of the education of the male and female partners in a
marriage or stable partnership. {p_end}

{pstd}It is hard to interpret this table as is, because of the differences in 
the margins.{p_end}

{pstd}For example, it appears that a {bf:female with medium vocational education} 
marying a {bf:male with lower vocational education} is more common than 
{it:vice versa}.{p_end}

{pstd}This is contrary to the notion that partnerships where the men are better 
educated are more common. {p_end}

{pstd}But the observed pattern may be due to the fact that 
{bf:lower vocational education} is more common among men than women, and 
{bf:medium vocational education} is more common among women than men.{p_end}

{pstd}Can't we change the table such that the pattern of association remains 
constant, but all the margins are the same, e.g. 100?{p_end}

{pstd}That would make it easier to see patterns.{p_end}

{pstd}Last week we solved this problem by looking at how independence was defined
in a chi-square test:{p_end}

{pstd}We imagined what the table would look like if the margins remained as we 
observed them, but there is no other association between the row and column 
variable{p_end}

{pstd}This week we turn this around: We keep the association in the table as 
observed, but change the margins. ({view slide14.smcl##yule12:Yule 1912}; {view slide14.smcl##agresti02:Agresti 2002} p. 345-346){p_end}
