{pstd}The row totals are as we want them, but the column totals are not. What
if we repeat this process for the columns?{p_end}

{pstd}Now the column totals are as we want them, but now the row totals are a
bit off.{p_end}

{pstd}However, the row totals are better than in the original table, so maybe
