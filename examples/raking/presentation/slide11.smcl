{pstd}We have until now keept the patern as observed in the data, and changed 
the margins. Can we not turn that around: Keep the margins as observed in the 
data, and change the pattern?{p_end}

{pstd}An interesting baseline pattern would be independence. We would start with
a table that satisfies independence, and change the values such that the margins
correspond to the observed margins. A table that satisfies independence is a 
table with all 1s.{p_end}

{pstd}Notice that the second iteration added nothing, so the IPF converged in 
one iteration. Also, the estimated counts correspond to the counts we computed 
last week.{p_end}

{pstd}This is not a coincidence:{p_end}

{pmore}In the first step of the first iteration, each cell gets 1/5 rowtotal{p_end}

{pmore}At the begining of the second step of the first iteration, the collumn 
totals are 1/5th of N{p_end}

{pmore}So we get: (rowtotal/5)/(N/5)*coltotal = (rowtotal*coltotal)/N {p_end}
