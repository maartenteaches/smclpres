{center:{bf: Can all tables be standardized?}}

{pstd}Consider the following table{p_end}

        0 0 2
        1 5 2
        8 7 0
    
{pstd}In order to make the first row total 100, the top right cell {it:must} be 
100{p_end}    

{pstd}In order to make the last column total 100, the top right cell {it:cannot} 
be 100{p_end}

{pstd}This is an example of a table that cannot be standardized. The Mata program
we created above will stop after 30 iterations, but the condition 
{cmd:mreldif(muhat2,muhat)>1e-8} will not be met. In other words the algorithm 
has not converged. The {cmd:stdtable} command will give a more explicit warning 
when that happens.
