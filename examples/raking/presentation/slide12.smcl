{pstd}Samples often deviate from the population because of{p_end}
{phang2}The way the sample was drawn{p_end}
{phang2}the way the data was collected{p_end}
{phang2}some people are harder to contact{p_end}
{phang2}some people are less likely to participate{p_end}

{pstd}What if we had the marginal distriubtion of our variables from the 
population?{p_end}

{pstd}Can't we use the same trick to standardize our table to those population
margins?{p_end}

{pstd}This is a classic application of raking, and is often used when computing
(post-stratification) weights.{p_end}
