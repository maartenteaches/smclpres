{pstd}The algorithm is called Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) ({view slide14.smcl##kruithof37:Kruithof 1937}; {view slide14.smcl##deming_stephan40:Deming and Stephan 1940}){p_end}

{pstd}We can automate this repeating using a loop, and in particular we want to
continue the loop until the table does not change anymore.{p_end}

{pstd}Standardizing a table like this is nice in a teaching setting, because 
you can see what is going on. In a real analysis you use the {* digr <a href="#slide6.smcl">&gt;&gt; stdtable</a>}{view slide6.smcl:>> stdtable}{* /digr} package{p_end}
