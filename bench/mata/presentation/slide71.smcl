{pstd}
A {helpb [M-2] struct:struct} is another way of storing multiple things in a 
single object.

{pstd}
The difference is that what it contains and their names have to be declared 
beforehand.

{pstd}
This makes it quicker to store and retrieve things and there is automatic error 
checking, but is less flexible.

{pstd}
I use {cmd:struct}s in larger projects with many subroutines and I have a large 
amount of information to move between those routines.
