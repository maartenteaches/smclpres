{center:{bf: macros and scalars in Stata}}

{pstd}
A macro is a shorthand, it is one thing standing for another

{pstd}
It can contain anything, but is always a string
 
{* ex slide21ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        local mac "foo"
        di `mac'
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide21ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
I said that the content of a macro is always a string, then why did this return 
an error?

{pstd}
The double quotes are there to indicate that this is a string, but they are not 
part of the string.

{pstd}
So `mac' contains {it:foo} not {it:"foo"}

{pstd}
So for the second line Stata saw {cmd:di foo}, and since there were no double 
quotes Stata assumed we wanted to look at a variable (or scalar) foo, could not
find that variable and returned the error message.

{pstd}
This will work:
 
{* ex slide21ex2 }{...}
{cmd}
        local mac "foo"
        di "`mac'"
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide21ex2.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
Because the quotes are stripped, macros may also contain numbers.

{pstd}
They are stored as strings, but as soon as Stata replaces the name of the macro
with its content it will see them as numbers, as there are no quotes around them.
 
{* ex slide21ex3 }{...}
{cmd}
        local mac 1
        di `mac'
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide21ex3.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
However, numbers stored in macros are not quite as precise as numbers stored in
scalars.

{pstd}
Scalars are stored in double precision (15-16 decimal digits), while locals have
about 12 decimal digits, sometimes more, but never less than 11.

{pstd}
A scalar is a "container" containing one element, either a string or a number.

{pstd}
It is good practice to use tempnames for scalars as they share the same namespace
as variables

{pstd}
{cmd:tempname} stores the names it reserves in a local macro, so we can use 
{cmd:st_local} to recover that.
