{center:{bf: Passing functions to functions}}

{pstd}
A common application of pointers is to pass a function to another function.

{pstd}
A pointer can point to functions as well as data
 
{* ex slide64ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        mata clear
        
        void greetings(string scalar who)
        {
            printf("Hello " + who)
        }   
        
        p = &greetings()
        
        (*p)("BIBB")
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide64ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
We have seen an application in {cmd:moptimize}

{pstd}
We created a function {cmd:logiteval()} that computes our log likelihood, and we
needed to pass that on to {cmd:moptimize}, which we did with the line:

{pmore}
{cmd:moptimize_init_evaluator(M, &logiteval())}
