{center:{bf: What is a pointer}}

{pstd}
Variables and functions are stored in memory

{pstd}
These objects have an address, so the computer is able to find these.

{pstd}
These addresses are just a number

{pstd}
This is what a {helpb [M-2] pointers:pointer} is  

{pstd} 
If we type {cmd:p = &x}, then p is a pointer, which points to x

{pstd} 
If we type {cmd:*p}, then we refer to contents of that address, or we derefernce p
