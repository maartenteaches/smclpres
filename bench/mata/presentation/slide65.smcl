{center:{bf: Try it yourself: approximating a function with a linear spline}}

{pstd}
We are writing a program to approximate a function with a set of linear splines

{pstd}
We need to find the knots

{pmore}
We start with a lower and upper bound

{pmore}
we look at the middle, and see if the approximation there is good enough

{pmore}
If it is not, we add a knots

{pmore}
We continue adding knots till the approximation is good enough

{pstd}
Here is a first attempt:

//codefile sp_approx01.do "sp_approx01"

{pstd}
The function we want to approximate is now hard coded in our program. We could 
make this more general with pointers

{pstd}
Do so

//apcodefile sp_approx02.do "(solution)"
