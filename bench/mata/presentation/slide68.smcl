Say we observed a matrix at three points in time.

{pstd}
Our results are:
 
{* ex slide68ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        A1 = 2, 5, 3 \
             2, 3, 9
        
        A2 = 4, 6, 2 \
             1, 4, 2 
              
        A3 = 6, 2, 7 \
             2, 5, 1       
        end     
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide68ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
We want to store them in a single object, using pointers

{pstd}
extract from that object the value for t=2, row=2, col=3

{* apcodefile threeD.do (solution) }{pstd}{stata "doedit threeD.do":(solution)}{p_end}
