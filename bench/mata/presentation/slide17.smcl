{pstd}
You can store parts of a Stata dataset as a matrix using {helpb mf_st_data:st_data()}.

{pstd}
In its simplest form it accepts two arguments{p_end}
{pmore}The first argument specifies the rows{p_end}
{pmore}The second argument specifies the columns{p_end}
 
{* ex slide17ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        sysuse auto, clear
        
        mata:
        y = st_data(.,"foreign rep78")
        y
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide17ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
Notice that we have missing values, which we may want to ignore

{pstd}
One posibility is to set a third argument equal to 0. This will ignore all
observations with at least one missing value on one of the specified variables.
 
{* ex slide17ex2 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata: 
        y = st_data(.,"foreign rep78", 0)
        y
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide17ex2.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
Alternatively, that third argument can be a variable

{pstd}
non-zero values indicate that that observation is to be included, while a value 
of zero means that that observation is to be ignored

{pstd}
In programming, this is the most common way to do this
 
{* ex slide17ex3 }{...}
{cmd}
        gen byte touse = !missing(foreign, rep78)
        mata:
        y = st_data(.,"foreign rep78", "touse")
        y
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide17ex3.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}
