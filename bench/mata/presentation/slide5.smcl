{hline}

{center:{bf: Try it yourself}}

{pstd}
Enter Mata using {cmd:mata}

{pstd}
Type {cmd:1 + 2}

{pstd}
OK, so if we type an expression which has an answer, that answer is displayed on
screen. In fact, that answer is not stored anywhere.

{pstd}
Type {cmd:a = 1 + 2}

{pstd}
Type {cmd:a}

{pstd}
OK, so with an equal sign we can store answers

{pstd}
Lets make an error: type {cmd:a = b}. We have not defined {cmd:b} yet, so what 
can Mata do other than return an error?

{pstd}
Notice that the command prompt is still {cmd::}, i.e. we are still in Mata

{pstd}
Lets fix the error, type {cmd:b = "Hello"} and {cmd:a = b}

{pstd}
Leave Mata by typing {cmd:end}

{pstd}
We can try one-line execution of Mata commands from Stata: Type {cmd:mata: 1 + 2}

{pstd}
Lets try the same sequence of commands but with {cmd:mata:} instead of 
{cmd:mata}. You can copy the commands below in the .do file editor and run it:

{cmd}
    clear mata
    mata:
    1 + 2
    a = 1 + 2
    a
    a = b
    b = "Hello"
    a = b
    end
