{center:{bf: things persist between Mata sessions}}

{pstd}
Things you create in Mata persist between Mata sessions untill you clear Mata or
you close Stata

{pstd}
That is why I added {cmd:clear mata} to the last exercise:{p_end}
{pmore}The purpose was for the first line {cmd:a = b} to result in an error.{p_end} 
{pmore}However, in the previous exercise we successfuly created {cmd:b}, which 
will persist between sessions, so no error would occur.{p_end}
{pmore}To make the desired error occur we needed to explicitly remove it{p_end}

{cmd}
        mata:
        a = 1
        b = 2
        end
        
        mata: a
        
        mata:
        a + b
        
        mata clear
        a
        end
