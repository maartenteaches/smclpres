{center:{bf: Counting words}}

{pstd}
Counting how often each word appears in a document is a classic application for 
an associative array

{pstd}
We can use {helpb mata fopen():fopen()} to open a file 

{pstd}
A basic start would be:
 
{* ex slide77ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        mata clear
        mata set matastrict on
        
        hist = AssociativeArray()
        hist.notfound(0)
        fh = fopen("spd.txt", "r")
        
        while ((line=fget(fh))!=J(0,0,"")) {
            line = tokens(line)
            for (i=1; i <= cols(line); i++) {
                freq = hist.get(line[i]) + 1
                hist.put(line[i], freq)
            }
        }
        fclose(fh)
        
        hist.keys()[1..10,.]
        hist.get("SPD")
        end
