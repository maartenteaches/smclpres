{center:{bf: Common "meaningless" words}}

{pstd}
There are some words that are very common, but don't interest us

{pstd}
For example, "der", "die", und "das" 
 
{* ex slide80ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata: hist.get("die")
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide80ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
So we don't want to count those

{pstd}
The file "stop_words_german.txt" contains a list of these words

{pstd}
We can read that file into Mata using {helpb mata fopen():fopen()}

{pstd}
Put all words in an associative array called stopwords (with a value 1, which 
does not matter)

{pstd}
When we count the words from the main file, we first check if that words exists
in the array stopwords (stopwords.exists()) and only count if that is not the case
