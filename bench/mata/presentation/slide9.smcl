{pstd}
Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication work as you would expect with 
the {cmd:+}, {cmd:-}, and {cmd:*} operators:
 
{* ex slide9ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        A = 1 , 2 \        
            3 , 2           
        
        b = 1     \
            2
        
        C = 2 , 4 \   
            1 , 3    
        
        A + C 
        
        A - C 
        
        A * C 
        
        A * b
        end 
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide9ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar works as expected

{pstd}
By analogy, division by a scalar works just fine with the {cmd:/} operator

{pstd}
The {cmd:/} operator does not work matrix division
 
{* ex slide9ex2 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        A*2
        A/2
        A / C
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide9ex2.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
You can transpose a matrix with {cmd:'}
 
{* ex slide9ex3 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        b'
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide9ex3.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}
