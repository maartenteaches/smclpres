{center:{bf: Finding the most common words}}

{pstd}
So what are the most commonly used words in this document?

{pstd}
We can extract a vector of words using {cmd:hist.keys()}, which we will call words

{pstd}
We create a new numeric vector (count) with the same number of rows, loop over 
those and fill these cells with the corresponding counts

{pstd}
We use {helpb mata sort():order()} to create a permutation vector: The first 
cell in that vector contains the rownumber that cell should be for it to be 
ordered, etc. We will call that vector o

{pstd}
We can now order both words and count using {cmd:words = words[o]} and the same 
for count

{pstd}
Do this

{* apcodefile hist04.do (solution) }{pstd}{stata "doedit hist04.do":(solution)}{p_end}
