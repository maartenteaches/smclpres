For estimation commands a minimalist certification script that is quick to write
and can pick up a lot of bugs before you go public would consider:

Often there are special cases of your model, where you know what the solution is.
In our cases, that would be the model without covariates.

{pmore}
You can "manually" implement an {cmd:if} condition by just dropping the unwanted
observations. Adding an {cmd:if} condition and the manual way, should yield the
exact same results

{pmore}
You can "manually" implement {cmd:fweight}s by {helpb expand:expanding} the 
dataset. Adding an {cmd:fweight}s and the manual way, should yield the
exact same results

{pstd}
A more complete certification script would also certify the (Mata) subroutines

A basic certification script for the {cmd:my_logit} command is here:

{* codefile my_logit_cert.do }{pstd}{stata "doedit my_logit_cert.do":certification script}{p_end}
