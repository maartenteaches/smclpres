{pstd}
We are going to write a program that receives a text file and returns a dataset
that contains a list of all words that occured in that file and how many times 
it appeared

{pstd}
We will write this using a class

{pstd}
The reason we do that, is that we think we want to extend this program (text 
analysis is a huge field)

{pstd}
We are writing this program with the goal that it should be easy to maintain and
extend
