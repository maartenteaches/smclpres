{pstd}
In Mata something is either a variable or a function

{pstd}
Functions are like programs. We will discuss them later

{pstd}
Anything that is not a function is a variable

{pstd}
The purpose of a variable is to store information

{pstd}
Variables differ depending on what is stored and how it is organized 

{pstd}In Mata a variable can contain either: {p_end}
{pmore}A real number (real){p_end}
{pmore}A complex number (complex){p_end}
{pmore}Text (string){p_end}
{pmore}The address where another object is stored in memory (pointer){p_end}
{pmore}A set of variables tied together under one name (struct){p_end}
{pmore}A set of variables and functions tied together under one name (class){p_end}

{pstd}This information can be organized as a:{p_end}
{pmore}scalar{p_end}
{pmore}rowvector{p_end}
{pmore}colvector{p_end}
{pmore}matrix{p_end}
