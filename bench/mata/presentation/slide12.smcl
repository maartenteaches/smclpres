{pstd}
Like in Stata 0 is false, and non-zero (including missing) is true

{pstd}
Operators or functions that return true or false will return 0 for false and 1 
for true

{pstd}The basic operators are:{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:==} for equals{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:!=} for not equals{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:>} for larger than{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:>=} for larger than or equal{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:<} for less than{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:<=} for than than or equal{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:!} for negation{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:&} for and{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:|} for or{p_end}
