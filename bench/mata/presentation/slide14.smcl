There is a limit on how precise numbers are stored on computers

{pstd}
If a computer stored numbers in decimal format we would not be surprised that we
could not store the number 1/3 exactly; we would have to stop storing 3s 
otherwise we would need an infinite amount of memory to store one number.

{pstd}
A computer however stores numbers in binary format. In binary some numbers we would
not consider problematic, are actualy like 1/3. The most common example is 0.1. 

{pstd}
So a lot of numbers we think are perfectly "normal" are in a computer actually 
rounded versions of that number.
