{pstd}
This way of storing number allows us to reliably store number within a very large
range.

{pstd}
It has some quirks, for example adding numbers that differ by a large order of
magnitude can lead to quite large rounding errors.

{pstd}
We want to add 1,000,000 and 0.0001

{pmore}
Then we are adding +1*1,00000*10^6 and +1*1.00000*10^-4

{pmore}
In order to add them we would need to the exponent the same:

{pmore}
We would change +1*1.00000*10^-4 to +1*0.00000000001*10^6

{pmore}
However, we only stored 6 digits, so 0.00000000001 gets rounded to 0 

{pstd}
A common computations where this could be a problem are: 

{pmore}
Computing a sum of values in a large matrix
