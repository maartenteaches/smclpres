Do the same to your 2sls program

The {cmd:syntax} I would use is:

{cmd}
    syntax varlist(numeric) [if] [in], ///
         endog(varlist numeric)        ///
         instruments(varlist numeric)
{txt}

{pstd}
The first variable in varlist is the dependent, and the remaining variables are 
the exogenous variables.
