{pstd}
Do the same for your 2sls model

{pstd}
As arguments we want the dependent variable, the exogenous variable, the endogenous
variables, the instruments, the constant, and the 
selection variable.

{pstd}
To get the variables for the {cmd:X} matrix we need to combine the names of the 
exogenous, endogenous, and the constant

{pstd}
To get the variables for the {cmd:Z} matrix we need to combine the names of the 
exogenous, instruments, and the constant

{pstd}
We can combine string scalars with {cmd:+}, but don't forget to add a 
space
