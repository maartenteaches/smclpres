{pstd}
One problem is that punctiation marks are still attached to the words. So 
"Menschen." is counted as a different word as "Menschen"

{pstd}
We could make a string with all the punctuation marks we want to remove 
(separated by spaces)

{pstd}
use {helpb mf_tokens:tokens()} to turn that into a vector

{pstd}
use {helpb Mata subinstr()} to remove those (i.e. replace it with an empty string "")
