{center:{bf: Maximum Likelihood}}

{pstd}
You start with a model, which has parameters, and dataset

{pstd}
Find those parameters that maximize the probability of observing the data 
assuming the model is true

{pstd}
{cmd:Example:} 

{pmore}
We want to know the probability that someone is a member of a trade 
union

{pmore}
Data: N persons and a binary variable {it:union}, which is 1 when the person is
a union member, and 0 when not

{pmore}
The model: There is a fixed probability {it:pi} that a person is a member

{pmore}
The likelihood: If someone is a member, then the probability of seeing such a 
person is {it:pi}

{pmore}
If someone is not a member then the probability of observing that person is 
(1-{it:pi})

{pmore}
Say we observe 3 union members and 2 non-members, then the likelihood is :

{pmore}
L({it:pi}|data) = {it:pi}*{it:pi}*{it:pi}*(1-{it:pi})*(1-{it:pi})

{pmore}
L({it:pi}|data) = Prod({it:pi}^union * (1-{it:pi})^(1-union)

{pmore}
We need to find the value of {it:pi} that maximizes L

{pstd}
It is actually more convenient to maximize the log of the likelihood

{pstd}
Remember:{p_end}
{pmore}ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b){p_end}
{pmore}ln(a^b) = b ln(a){p_end}

{pmore}
ln(L({it:pi}|data)) = ln(Prod({it:pi}^union * (1-{it:pi})^(1-union))

{pmore}
ln(L({it:pi}|data)) = sum(ln({it:pi}^union) + ln((1-{it:pi})^(1-union))

{pmore}
ln(L({it:pi}|data)) = sum(union*ln({it:pi}) + (1-union)*ln(1-{it:pi})

{pstd}
Typically, we don't think there is one probability for everybody, but we are 
interested in how that probability differs depending on explanatory variables

{pstd}
So we replace {it:pi} with a function of of those explanatory variables

{pstd}
A common choice is the logit function:{p_end}
{pmore}xb = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ...{p_end}
{pmore}{it:pi}= exp(xb)/(1-exp(xb)) = invlogit(xb){p_end}

{pstd}
This is logistic regression
