The formulas for the parameter estimates of 2sls model are:

{pstd}{cmd:b}      = ({cmd:X}'{cmd:MX})^-1{cmd:X}'{cmd:My}{p_end}
{pstd}{cmd:M}      = {cmd:Z}({cmd:Z}'{cmd:Z})^-1{cmd:Z}'{p_end}

{pstd}
They don't lend themselves so readily for {cmd:cross}, which is why we added the 
constants

{pstd}
Continue working in your do file and compute {cmd:M} and {cmd:b}
