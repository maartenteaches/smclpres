{pstd} Then we create new variables with {cmd:st_addvar()} to add the variables

{pstd}
For string variables we need to know the maximum length (in bytes, not characters)
of the words we want to store. We can get that with the {cmd:strlen()} function
and {cmd:max()} function

{pstd}
For numeric variables we can use {cmd:st_store()} to store the vector in the 
variable

{pstd}
For string variables we can use {cmd:st_sstore()}

{pstd}
But first we need to make sure there are enough observations in the Stata dataset
to take all those words. We can count the number of observation with {cmd:st_nobs()}
and add any extra observations we may need with {cmd:st_addobs()}
