Alternatively, you sometimes want to do something element by element 

{pstd}
For that you can add a colon in front of many operators
 
{* ex slide10ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        A
        b
        C
        
        A:*C
        A:*b
        A:*b'
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide10ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}

What rules does {cmd::*} apply to these matrices?
