We are going to implement a IV regression via two stage least squares 

{pstd}The data is hsng2{p_end}
{pstd}The dependent variable {cmd:y} is rent{p_end}
{pstd}The endogenous variable {cmd:Y} is hsngval{p_end}
{pstd}The instruments {cmd:X2} are faminc reg2 reg3 and reg4{p_end}
{pstd}The other exogenous variables {cmd:X1} is pcturban{p_end}

{pstd}
We need to load three matrices:{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:y}{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:X} = {cmd:Y}, {cmd:X1}, {cmd:cons}{p_end}
{pmore}{cmd:Z} = {cmd:X1}, {cmd:X2}, {cmd:cons}{p_end}

{pstd}
Open the dataset using {cmd:webuse}, create a new variable cons containing 1, and load the 
three matrices in Mata
