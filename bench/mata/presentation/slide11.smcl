We can get at cells in a matrix using {cmd:[]}:
 
{* ex slide11ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        A
        b
        
        A[2,1]
        b[2]
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide11ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
We can also get at multiple cells
 
{* ex slide11ex2 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        D = A, b
        D
        D[2,.]
        D[.,2]
        D[1,(2,3)]
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide11ex2.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
We can also specify the starting cell and the ending cell, and get the entire 
submatrix between those using {cmd:[||]}

{pstd}
This can be faster
 
{* ex slide11ex3 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        D[|1,2 \ 1,3|]
        end
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide11ex3.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}
