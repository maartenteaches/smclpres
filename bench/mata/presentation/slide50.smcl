{pstd}
If we assume that the dependent variable is Poisson distributed, then the 
probability of observing a person with {it:y} events is 

{pmore}
({it:mu}^y exp(-{it:mu}))/y!

{pstd}
Where {it:mu} is the mean number of events. In case of a Poisson the {it:lambda} 
is also common

{pstd}
So the probability of observing the data given a value of {it:mu} is

{pmore}
L(y|{it:mu}) = prod(({it:mu}^y exp(-{it:mu}))/y!)

{pstd}
Taking the logarithm:

{pmore}ln(L(y|{it:mu})) = ln(prod(({it:mu}^y exp(-{it:mu}))/y!)){p_end}
{pmore}ln(L(y|{it:mu})) = Sum(ln({it:mu}^y) + ln(exp(-{it:mu})) - ln(y!)){p_end}
{pmore}ln(L(y|{it:mu})) = Sum(y*ln({it:mu}) - {it:mu} - ln(y!)){p_end}

{pstd}
The mean in case of a Poisson distribution is the expected number of events, so 
has to be positive

{pstd}
We can make the mean dependent of explanatory variables and make sure that that 
mean remains positive by using exp(xb)

{pmore}ln(L(y|{it:b})) = Sum(y*ln(exp({cmd:Xb})) - exp({cmd:xb}) - ln(y!)){p_end}
{pmore}ln(L(y|{it:b})) = Sum(y*{cmd:Xb} - exp({cmd:xb}) - ln(y!)){p_end}

{pstd}
Create a Poisson regression in Mata, use the horse.dta dataset, create indicator 
variables for the cavelary units and use those as explanatory varialbes 
(excluding the reference unit)
