In said before that in Mata something is either a variable or a function, and we
have talked about variables

{pstd}
A function is a program, for example:
 
{* ex slide30ex1 }{...}
{cmd}
        mata:
        mata clear
        mata set matastrict off
        
        real scalar my_median(string scalar varn)
        {
            x = st_data(.,varn, 0)
            _sort(x,1)
            index = ceil(rows(x)/2)
            return(x[index])
        }
        end
        
        sysuse nlsw88, clear
        mata: my_median("tenure")
        sum tenure, detail
{txt}{...}
{pstd}({stata "do slide30ex1.do":{it:click to run}}){p_end}


{* endex }{...}
{pstd}
So we created a function called {cmd:my_median()}

{pstd}
But first we need to specify what kind of thing this function is going to return,
in our case a real scalar (a single number)

{pstd}
Within the parantheses we specify what our function expects as arguments{p_end}
{pmore}First what kind of thing it is, in our case a string scalar{p_end}
{pmore}Second the name it will have inside our function, in our case {it:varn}{p_end}

{pstd}
Whithin the braces we put what the function does, in our case:{p_end}
{pmore}We first loaded the data{p_end}
{pmore}Sorted that variable{p_end}
{pmore}Computed at what point the middle is{p_end}
{pmore}Returned the middle value{p_end}

{pstd}
It is a start, but there are still various problems with this function
